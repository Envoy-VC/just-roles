# Just Roles

The "Just Roles" smart contract just does what it says. It grants on-chain roles to users based on their Lens Protocol followers.

It uses the Phat Lens Oracle to retrieve data from an API endpoint and verifies the authenticity of the data within the network, ensuring that the results are un-tampered.

This contract offers flexibility by allowing users to customize role names and add or edit roles according to their specific requirements.

Additionally, users have the ability to set threshold upper and lower limits for each role, providing fine-grained control over role assignment.
